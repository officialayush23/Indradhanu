"""The policy gate.

An action does not issue because a model is confident. It issues because a
clause in the municipal disaster management plan or the NDMA guidelines
delegates it, and because the officer holding that delegation is the one
acting. This module is where that is decided.

Retrieval is exact-match on `action_key` today, with the pgvector column and a
similarity path already in place for when the corpus grows past a few dozen
clauses. Exact match is the right default for a delegation matrix: you do not
want fuzzy semantic similarity deciding whether an evacuation was authorised.

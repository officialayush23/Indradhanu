"""Flood adapter — LIVE.

Signal is GloFAS river discharge plus forecast rainfall; the score weights that
against terrain, drainage history and recorded past events. Reservoir discharge
is treated as a first-class driver rather than folded into rainfall, because in
Pune it frequently *is* the cause: the July 2024 event followed a planned
45,000-cusec release from Khadakwasla, not an unforecast downpour.

"""The hazard adapter contract.

This is the abstraction the whole platform rests on. Every hazard — flood,
heatwave, wildfire, air quality, seismic — implements the same five stages:

    signal(t) -> score(cell) -> exposure_join(cell) -> impact(cell) -> action_policy(impact)

Nothing downstream of this file knows which hazard it is handling. The
orchestrator, the solver, the decision gate, the alert composer and all three
interfaces operate on `ScoredWard` and `ProposedAction` alone. Adding cyclone
means writing one adapter, not touching any of them.

Adapters declare their own `maturity`. `LIVE` means the scorer is trained and
runs against real feeds; `REGISTERED` means it implements the contract but its
scorer is a placeholder. We surface that distinction in the API rather than
letting a stub masquerade as a model.

"""Connection pool.

One asyncpg pool for the process, opened on startup and closed on shutdown.
Queries are written as explicit SQL in the repository layer rather than through
an ORM: most of them are PostGIS spatial joins that an ORM would obscure, and
the query plan matters when a run scores every ward in a city.
